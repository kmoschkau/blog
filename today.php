			<p>Today I woke up before my alarm. I checked a phone app which informed my I slept 7 hours and 49 minutes, and experienced 5 full sleep cycles. I didn’t feel tired on waking. I spent too much time in bed and then took a shower. Washing myself consisted of rinsing my hair 3 times, leaning back into the spray and then rubbing my shoulders and face with a Dove beauty bar. Leaving the shower I brushed my teeth and inspected myself in the mirror. I had some acne on my arms and a small rash on my chest, which I applied a cream too that I didn’t expect to work. Most of my clothes were wrinkly from not hanging them after the dryer so I wore a jacket and down vest. I sent a photo of myself in this outfit to someone before I left the house and they said I matched my bathroom. </p>
			
			
			<p>I biked to work. On my way my wrist were cold because the jacket is slightly small and my leather gloves are rather short. I didn’t wear a scarf and halfway there I decided to zip up my jacket more. I wore wireless headphones and earmuffs under my hood. The rest of my body was warm. I listened to a lecture on Russian Literature which I enjoyed. The lecturer introduced Gogol and I was excited to begin because I have read one of his novellas.
</p>
			
			<p>I did not comb my hair before leaving, and it was wet and frozen when I arrived. I realized I had lost my comb the day before and left my brush in my other jacket. I stole a fork from the break room and surreptitiously ran it through my hair, glancing sideways every so often, wondering how strange my quiet coworker thinks I am.
			</p>
			
			<p>For breakfast at work I drank 2 cups of milk, 1 scoop of protein powder, 1 banana, 2 cups of oatmeal, ½ cup of raisins, and ½ cup of raspberries. It took me 2.5 hours to finish it. I realized for the third time this week I forgot to bring tea and was disappointed in myself.</p>
			
			<p>I talked to all of my coworkers today. At a meeting 2 of them gave me a curious, but not inquisitive, look over my outfit. I spend 30 minutes in the bathroom practicing Russian and went outside once. It hurt my eyes to look at the sun.</p>
			
			<p>I finished some code today and posted a screenshot of the output where I figured my manager would see it. I was proud of the simplicity and colors of the results and figured that it would reflect, me, as a person. I stayed late and 10 minutes before I left I was informed a server was blocking a user. I mistook the person who informed me for another coworker and sent several less than professional messages before I realized my mistake. I fixed the problem and he didn't respond back before I left. I didn’t really care.</p>

			<p>After work I went to the gym. On my way there I listened to more lectures on Gogol. The novella I read, The Overcoat, was the topic and I was excited. After listening to a summary and analysis of the novella, I realized I couldn’t remember many of the main points. I was disappointed in myself again and resolved to reread the story. </p>
			
			<p>At the gym I was able to increase my standing military press by 5 lbs and add 1 rep to my pull-up sets. I watched several snap stories, 1 of them sad. I wondered how that person would feel if I gave them $1000. I received messages from 3 girls while there. The first was complaining about not studying and I told her to turn to Jesus. The second sent me a message concerning her thoughts on suicide. I had to read it several times until I fully understood her point and then sent back my thoughts. The third asked my opinion of Full Metal Jacket. I stood half undressed in the locker room and explained my thoughts, using words like profundity, levity, heavy handed, lucid, and phenomenon. I related my ideas to an essay by David Foster Wallace analyzing a critic of Dostoevsky and mentioned Apocalypse Now. She replied with 1 word.<p>
			
			<p> I checked my weight on the scale and found I had lost 6 lbs in 14 days. I rechecked it. I was disappointed in myself yet again and resolved to better track my calories in the future. I took the last towel and spend 20 minutes in the sauna.</p>
			
			<p> It was 8:45 when I got home and I was hungry. </p>
