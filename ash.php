				We walked.<br>
				I watched the water and you watched me.<br>
				I never looked you in the eyes.<br>
				<br>
				We drank and wandered.<br>
				You told me stories and they unfolded in black and white.<br>
				Now two of us remember.<br>
				<br>
				I was a good place and a bad time.<br>
				I have clothes from there but not from then.<br>
				They're forgotten but for one.<br>
				<br>
				I left.<br>
				You stayed.<br>
				I left<br>
				Unanswered questions that stayed with you.<br>
