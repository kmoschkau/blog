				There is a questioning in the air and a quick passion blooms.<br>
				A single, simultaneous step. Bold in it's quickness yet constrained.<br>
				You hesitate<br>
				I hesitate<br>
				In our minds, we dance<br>
				Round one another.<br>
				Waiting but not waiting for the next turn. The next spin, a dip.<br>
				Completely alone within and without we twirl, moving, gyrating in spirals across the floor.<br>
				There is a momentum building. A slow climax toward an unspoken reach.<br>
				We move in and out. Closer then cut by distance.<br>
				A glance up.<br>
				A blink and the clearness of your eyes shines.<br>
				Two dark pools inviting to a dark realm.<br>
				Tempting, daring, and quickly rescinding back to tepid waters.<br>
				Nothing stops. Our footsteps proceed.<br>
				Moving lightly, faint sounds to remind us that time continues on.<br>
				In the mind each tempted by each, playing with seriousness itself.<br>
				The daring builds, pushing itself forward through deliberate steps. <br>
				Closer a warmth brushes through the air.<br>
				A quick moment is all it takes to come together. <br>
				And to come apart.<br>
				The dance goes on, drifting, drifting.<br>
