            <p>Are you filled with deep existential angst over the inevitability of death and pointlessness of human suffering? Do you also believe the debut season of Nic Pizzolettos show is possibly the greatest series ever created? </p>

			<p>Well, do I have something for you: True Detective classes, synced to various works of literature, philosophical treatise, and essays spanning the full first season. </p>

			<p>Through the works of Robert Chambers, Thomas Ligotti, and David Benatar, along with a host of writings by essayists by doctors in philosophy, we are going to understand True Detective like no-one has attempted to before.</p>

			<p>Pizzoletto drew his ideas from various philosophers dealing in anti-natalism and nihilism. Most of the quotes by Rust Cole are drawn directly from The Conspiracy Against the Human Race. The stories plot and symbolism are heavily influenced by Robert Chambers work The King in Yellow. There are other references to Lovecraft and many ideas drawn from philosophers including Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. </p>

			<p>All of these ideas will be examined and discussed on a weekly basis, through weekly readings and subsequent discussions happening over Google Hangouts. There will be all sorts of other fun stuff, like examinations of the filming styles and artistic influences and treats if you buy them for yourself.

            <span class="caption text-muted">"I think human consciousness, is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware, nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself, we are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self; an accretion of sensory, experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody is nobody. Maybe the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal." - Rust Cole</span>
