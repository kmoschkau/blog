			<p>If you have to rush in life, rush slowly.</p>

			<p>It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that it exists at all.</p>
			
			<p>Because in the end, you won't remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.</p>

			<p>Sometimes on gets the idea that life thinks its still living in Paris in the 30s.</p>
